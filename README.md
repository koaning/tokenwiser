> Bag of, not words, but tricks!

This project contains a couple of useful "tricks" for NLP projects. 

# Goal 

This project is meant as an open playground to rethink text classification by
exploring the idea of a `SentenceModel`. This is a model that makes a prediction
per sentence, in the attempt that this might helps saying something more general
about the entire document. Sentences might be easier to annotate and classify, so
maybe there's some sense in modelling this way.
