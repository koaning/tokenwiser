# tokenwiser

> Bag of, not words, but tricks!

This project contains a couple of "tricks" on tokens. It's a collection 
of tricks for sparse data that might be trained on a stream of data too.

While exploring these tricks was super fun, I do feel like there are plenty
of better alternatives than the ideas I explore here. In the end, TfIDF + LogReg
can be "fine" for a bunch of tasks that don't require embeddings. 

And for embeddings ... there's [embetter](https://github.com/koaning/embetter). 

So I archived this repo. Bit of a shame, because I _really_ liked the name of this package.
